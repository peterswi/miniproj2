                There were 4,931 individuals killed at the hands of police between 2015 and 2019. Each of these individuals are represented by a black square above; there were too many squares to fit all of them into a single-window visualization. It is important to remember that each square was a person who had a family and a life. Looking at the second page of the story, we can see that fatalities have actually increased over the years. This is troubling when we consider the increase in public awareness surrounding police brutality and issues within the American criminal justice system.

                After investigating how many people are killed each year, we wanted to find out if there were any patterns in the locations where these fatalities occur. As seen in the map above, there is clearly a link between population density and the number of killings that occur. However, what this map also shows is that these tragedies happen nationwide - no region or state is immune.

                As seen in the above storyboards, those in their 20s and 30s are disproportionately affected by killings at the hands of police. Though this issue affects people of all ages, there is a massive spike in these age groups. Looking at the gender, we can clearly see that men are killed at far higher rates than are women. Finally, though it appears that white people are killed at higher rates than are other racial groups (because their sections of the bars are larger), the following visualizations prove why this is not the case. Though white people make up approximately 60% of the US population, they do not make up 60% of those killed - therefore, minority racial groups are disproportionately affected by this issue.

                This visualization illustrates why we cannot use counts to make a judgment about which racial group is most affected by killings at the hands of police. We compare the racial proportions of those killed with the national racial breakdown. We can clearly see that Black people are killed at a rate much higher than their proportion of the national racial breakdown. Though Black people only make up about 13% of the national population, they are killed at a rate of about double that. This begs the question: why? Unfortunately, our data did not allow us to answer such a question, but this topic can be extended to do a more thorough analysis of the racial inequity in our justice system.

              With the most frequently killed age group being young men, we decided to look at this group in isolation to see if perhaps we could identify any disparities in this case, and we found quite stunning results. For ages 18-24, the numbers of police killings on black and white men are incredibly close. If we adjust in the proportions of population that are actually white and black, these results are even more vivid. Young black men are extremely over-represented in police killings.

              We also decided to look only at killings on individuals who were reported to have been unarmed. In this data story we first show the total police killings of white and black people in general, and then in the next chart we see only the killings on unarmed black and white people. This ivsualization is particularly effective because it shows a massive jump in deaths of black men as compared to white men when they were unarmed. This shows that in the case where black men and white men are unarmed, when we control for proportion of population, far more black men are killed.

                                When we began the process of looking for a good data set, the data everyone seemed most interested in was related to political and social issues. We initially considered doing our project on the 2020 election, but Erin found a cool dataset from fivethirtyeight on hate crimes and police killings we all found interesting. As we played around with that data, we were looking for ways to show certain races killed by police in proportion to the population. That’s when we found the Washington Post’s police killings dataset
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Washington Post had a data set which was the most thorough one we had encountered related to individuals killed by police. The previous data we were working with only consisted of 2015, and the Washington Post’s had data from 2015-2020. It also included additional details about the police encounters -- such as how the person was killed and if they had any weapons on them. All in all, we settled on the Washington Post’s data and were able to create much more enlightening visualizations from it.

                                While we did cycle through multiple different datasets, ultimately we did not have to do much processing or cleaning of the data. At first, we thought we may need to update the abbreviations used for the states in our dataset in order to be able to merge datasets or reference a different dataset, but we ultimately moved away from that idea. In the end, the only meaningful processing we did was creating some new values to be used within our dataset. These values were the proportion of the population that each major race represented in the dataset used, as shown above.

                        We began the exploration process with lots of questions. During a group brainstorm, we came up with the following questions: How many people killed in the US in 2015? When and where are they being killed? Were most armed or unarmed? What was the gender of the victims? What about the age of victims? Which racial group gets killed by police in the highest proportion with respect to race’s portion of the population? And the least? How did being armed or unarmed affect the killings? How did being armed affect the killings when you throw race into the mix? How are people most often killed? Does the racial breakdown of a town affect who the victims are?

                        When we were creating visualizations to show the locations where killings took place, Erin and Kathryn each created different ways to display the data. The visualizations ended up looking pretty similar at first glance -- with Erin's maps showing large dots where most killings were clustered, and Kathryn's showing individual dots for every killing. The main difference was the size of the individual dots. Both maps used semantic zoom, which is a form of zoom where the dots remain the exact same size when zooming in but appear further apart. Because Erin's visualization showed larger dots in the clustered areas, the dots representing individual killings are very small and hardly able to be seen -- especially when you zoom in. Although Kathryn's visualization had a better appearance when zooming in, we decided to use Erin's. We made this decision because we figured the way this visualization would be most used is by looking at the full national map to identify clusters. This experience taught us about the give and take which can be involved in choosing the right visualization.

                    Above, you can see how we arrived at two important conclusions based on our exploratory visualizations: Firstly, by and large, police shootings kill <i>young males</i>.
                    Secondly, the graph above on the right shows how disproportionately <i>Black people</i> are being killed.

                        <p>
                            Our group was excited to produce visualizations on this topic because we all believe it is an important and relevant issue. Data visualizations can help expose when injustice is occurring in our society. An example of this is our visualization which showed the difference between racial proportions and races most killed by police -- with Black individuals having the highest killings proportionally. When visualizations are enlightening, or help people see the truth, they can inspire societal changes.

                            There is a lot of data available on killings by police. This was both helpful and difficult for our group. While having a lot of data to pull from was useful as we crafted an informative web page, we also found ourselves debating which datasets to use many times over. At first, we were focusing on a dataset that only had data on police killings in 2015 (dataset found <u><a href='https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings'>here</a></u> ). The 2015 dataset had a variety of interesting data on economic factors in various communities, but ultimately there were not enough data points for us to draw a meaningful enough conclusion. As we looked for inspiration as to how to effectively visualize such an important topic, we found an article by the Washington Post that had excellent visualizations for maximum impact. We tracked down the dataset that they used, and, careful not to copy the Washington Post’s visualizations, decided that having data from 2015-2020 was going to allow us to craft a much more impactful argument.

                    <li><u>Initial Structure</u></li>
                        <p>
                            We initially began work with completely different datasets than we used in our final deliverable. The datasets we were working with had hate crime data and police killing data from 2015. We thought that linking these two ideas would be a really interesting investigation, so initially our structure was going to be broken into three parts. First, we would investigate hate crimes in the US; second, we would explore police killings data; finally, we would link the two with visualizations that combined the dataset.

                        <p>
                            Though this seemed like a viable structure, we found that our data did not tell a compelling enough story to make the website interesting for users. Additionally, the two datasets pulled us in two different directions - the hate crimes data set showed an interesting relationship with economic conditions, and the police killings dataset told a story about who is most affected (similar to the story that we ended up telling). We realized that it was critical that we not try to make our data fit a narrative we had crafted. If we did that, our visualizations would not have been Truthful. This led us to switch our datasets and turn to a “funnel” structure to tell a more focused, true, and impactful story.

                    <li><u>How we ended here</u></li>
                    <p>
                        When thinking about how to structure the story we told, we decided to take a “funnel” approach. In other words, we wanted to present the issue very broadly, and as readers explored further down the website, narrow down our focus. This somewhat mimicked our own experience with the data, as we began our investigation broadly, and as we made discoveries, chose to focus on certain elements over others. This methodology can be seen in the way that we present the data on a national scale, proving why this issue is relevant to all, and then focus on who is being most affected by such tragedies.

                        An important part of our storytelling was humanizing the victims. Throughout the process, we often reminded ourselves and one another that each datapoint represented a human life. This goal was furthered by our deployment of the funneling methodology. It is easy to get lost in the data when it is presented on a national scale. When we focus on demographics such as age, gender, and race, users are better able to connect to the data and understand the human element of it. For instance, users first recognize that over 4,900 people have been killed by police since 2015. Then, as they scroll, they can examine how this large number breaks down by age, gender, and race. It is quickly apparent that certain populations are affected more than others, and this is emphasized by having additional visualizations that call out these demographic elements on their own.
